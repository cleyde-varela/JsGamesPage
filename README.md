# JsGamesPage

## ðŸ“Œ About this project
This page was created in order to compile a collection of simple JavaScript games in an user friendly way. The games use simple Javascript code and very minimal CSS styling.
* The games were built following the _amazing_ tutorial by **Ania KubÃ³w** (https://github.com/kubowania) at FreeCodeCamp with my personal additions. You can check it at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec8vSKJuZTk, I strongly recommend it for anyone trying to get started on Javascript.
  
## ðŸ“Œ The reason behind it
My main objective with this project was to refresh some of my Javascript knowledge. I choose games since they're fun, very visual and I could later let my
younger sister get to play with it.

## ðŸ“Œ Specifications
The page includes the following games:
* Rock Paper Scissors
* Connect four
* Whac a mole
* Memory game
* Breakout
* Space Invaders

It explores some basic Js such as loops, if and switch statements, functions, as well as some inbuilt functions and DOM manipulation.

## ðŸ“Œ How to use it
You can run the code on your local machine using Visual Studio CodeðŸ‘‹
